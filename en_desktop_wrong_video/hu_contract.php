						I. GENERAL RULES
						1. EFFECT OF THE GENERAL CONTRACTUAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF RETAIL LOANS
						1.1. These General Contractual Terms and Conditions (hereinafter referred to as the GCTC) apply to any
						service classified as a Retail Loan Facility to be provided as a credit or a money loan by K&H Bank Zrt.
						(Bank) to natural persons pursuant to Act No CCXXXVII of 2013 on Credit Institutions and Financial
						Enterprises (Hpt.).
						1.2. The provisions of the GCTC shall be classified as contractual conditions with regard to all the Retail
						Loans, which are accepted by the Client when signing the individual Client Agreement for using a given
						Retail Loan. The provisions of these GCTC shall apply also if provided so by an agreement by and
						between the Client and the Bank for a service outside the scope of these GCTC.
						2. GENERAL DEFINITIONS
						The expressions listed below shall have the following meaning when these GCTC and the Client Agreement are
						applied:
						2.1. Debtor: the natural person entitled to use the Bank’s service for which the Bank provides a defined
						cash amount based on the Loan Agreement.
						2.2. Co-debtor: the person who together with the Debtor assumes joint and several liability for the
						repayment of the loan and the payment of the related fees and charges.
						2.3. Collateral: any collateral indicated in the individual Client Agreement, defined – subject to the nature
						of the collateral – in the Loan Agreement or in a special collateral agreement or any other deed and
						covering the Debtor’s and/or Co-debtor’s obligations under the Loan Agreement (especially but not
						exclusively payment guarantees, security deposits and pledges).
						2.4. Collateral agreement: an agreement for establishing collateral irrespective of whether the Bank
						concludes it with the Debtor, the Co-debtor or any other obligor.
						2.5. BUBOR: the Budapest interbank offered rate expressed in an annual percent rate, which is determined
						according to the current provisions set out in the regulations of the Hungarian FOREX Club and is
						published on the Reuters ‘BUBOR’ page (or, in the lack of that, on the appropriate Telerate page) as
						the BUBOR rate. It is the Loan Agreement that specifies which of the various BUBORs of different
						terms is to be applied.
						2.6. Condition(s) precedent: all the conditions under the Loan Agreement that shall be met or the Bank is
						not obliged to provide any service for the Client even after the Agreement has entered into force.
						2.7. Prepayment: any repayment before the Due Date of the repayment instalment or above the amount of
						the due repayment instalment.
						2.8. Due Date: a date defined as such in the Client Agreement, on which the Debtor shall fulfil any of its
						payment obligations due under the Loan Agreement.
						2.9. EURIBOR (Euro Interbank Offered Rate): the offered interest rate determined according to the
						provisions of the European Central Bank’s regulations and quoted on the Frankfurt interbank market.
						2.10. Consumer Loan: a loan granted to a natural person for purchasing or repairing the general every-day
						articles of personal use and for using services or a multipurpose loan if the loan is used by a natural
						person outside the scope of its independent profession or normal business activity.
						RETAIL LOANS 4
						2.11. Consumer: a natural person acting in pursuit of objectives beyond their independent occupation or
						business activities
						2.12. Disbursement Date: the day on which the Bank provides the loan to the Debtor by transferring it to
						the Client’s retail bank account or in any other way. If the credit purpose under the Loan Agreement is
						achieved by disbursing the amount of the loan to a third party, the Disbursement Date is the day on
						which the Bank credits the amount of the loan to a special blocked account opened for the Debtor for
						this purpose.
						2.13. Tenor: a period of time defined in the Client Agreement during which the Debtor shall repay the loan
						and the interest and charges. The starting date of the Tenor is the Disbursement Date of the loan, which
						is also the starting date of the first Interest Period and the first Transaction Year. The last day of the
						Tenor is the Maturity Date.
						2.14. Monthly Minimum Credited Amount: applicable to overdraft facility Loan Agreements, this is the
						minimum amount credited to the overdraft registration bank account which is to be granted by the
						Debtor monthly
						2.15. Announcement: a prospectus displayed in the bank branches (in the Bank’s client areas), published
						in the way defined in the relevant law, including primarily the interests, the service fees, the other
						charges to be paid by the Debtor (Co-debtor), the default interests, the method of the interest
						calculation, the total credit fee ratio (APR) and the minimum conditions of application and forming part
						of the Agreement.
						2.16. Interest Rate Margin: part of the transactional interest rate in excess of the reference rate of interest.
						2.17. Interest Rate Margin Period: time period for the duration of which the interest rate margin is not
						changed.
						2.18. Interest Rate Change Ratio: a ratio published on the Central Bank of Hungary’s website, which is
						used in the modification of the interest rate, is related to refinancing costs and the provision of the loan,
						but is unrelated to the business risk run by the Bank, and objectively reflects lending risk factors that
						are beyond the Bank’s sphere of influence.
						2.19. Interest Rate Margin Change Ratio: a ratio used in the modification of the interest rate margin; it
						represents the change over the base of some reference rate or reference yield and shows by how much
						the part of the interest rate exceeding the reference rate of interest may be changed.
						2.20. Interest Period: the period related to the transactional interest of the loan during which the rate of the
						transactional interest will remain unchanged.
						2.21. Accounting Date of Interest Period/Interest Margin Period: the calendar day following the end of
						an Interest Period/Interest Margin Period.
						2.22. Payment Guarantor: any natural person or legal entity which undertakes to pay as an unconditional
						payment guarantor pursuant to the provisions of the relevant Collateral Agreement in case the Debtor
						(or other Co-debtor) does not pay on the Due Date.
						2.23. Loan Agreement: the total documentation of the agreement concluded by and between the Bank and
						the Debtor with respect to the given Service, the Retail Loan, also including state subsidies mediated
						by the Bank, which consists particularly of the Bank’s General Terms and Conditions, these GCTC, the
						Client Agreement, the collateral agreements and the Announcement concerning the given loan type.
						Under the Loan Agreement, the Bank’s main obligation is to disburse the agreed loan amount, whereas
						the Debtor’s main obligation is to repay the loan principal and to pay the interest and miscellaneous
						charges stated in the Loan Agreement for the due dates defined in the Loan Agreement.
						RETAIL LOANS 5
						2.24. Retail Loan: the Consumer Loan and the Mortgage Loan.
						2.25. Housing Loan: loan granted subject to registration of mortgage on real estate – including mortgage
						established as independent pledge– to purchase, construct, enlarge, modernise or renovate residential
						property as being the loan purpose stipulated by the Parties in the Client Agreement; or to replace a
						loan granted for a purpose as per the above (the amount of the latter may exceed the amount
						outstanding as of the replacement of the original debt solely as a result of the exchange rate variation
						between lenders/financing partners and with the fees and charges confirmed as required for closing
						the original outstanding credit facility or loan and for disbursing the new loan).
						2.26. Maturity Date: the end-date under the Client Agreement by which the Debtor shall pay all its debts to
						the Bank under the Loan Agreement. The Maturity Date is the last day of the Tenor.
						2.27. LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate): the reference offered interest rate quoted on the London
						interbank market.
						2.28. Mortgage Loan: credit facility or loan granted to a consumer against a mortgage registered on real
						estate (also including mortgages registered as independent pledges)
						2.29. Reference Rate of Interest: a generally published fixing used in determining a rate of interest, which
						is beyond the lender’s sphere of influence.
						2.30. Annual percentage rate (APR): an internal rate of return, based on which the present value of the
						Debtor’s repayment obligation (repayment plus fees), expressed as an annual rate, equals the total
						loan amount disbursed by the creditor.
						2.31. APR Decree: the prevailing regulation governing the definition, calculation and promulgation of the
						annual percentage rate
						2.32. Principal balance: the amount of the disbursed loan decreased by the principal content of the paid
						Repayment Instalments.
						2.33. Repayment Instalment: the amount payable by the Client during the tenor with a frequency and in an
						amount as defined in the Loan Agreement, which, unless otherwise provided for by contract or by law,
						includes the amount of the due repayment of principal, the interest and the handling fee.
						2.34. Repayment Account: an account managed by the Bank and having a repayment function, through
						which the repayment of the loan is channelled.
						2.35. Loan Repayment Account: a technical Repayment Account linked to a consumer loan, solely used
						for the purpose of loan repayment, and held for the account holder free of charge. Any amounts paid
						to the Loan Repayment Account in excess of the repayment instalment becoming due will be kept in
						safe custody by the Bank until the next repayment date and will be used for the settlement of the
						following instalment. Cash withdrawals from a Loan Repayment Account can only be performed at a
						cash counter of a bank branch, subject to the payment of fee.
						2.36. Transaction Year (client year): the first transaction year (client year) starts with the Disbursement
						Date and lasts for 12 months following the Due Date of the first repayment instalment; the next
						transaction year is one year following the end of the preceding transaction year.

						3. LOAN APPLICATION, CREDIT DECISION, REFUSAL TO DISBURSE
						3.1. The Bank grants Retail Loans upon the submission of a credit application to be assessed by individual
						credit decision procedure at the Bank’s own well-judged discretion and subject to the Bank’s own terms
						and conditions. In its credit approval process, the Bank acts in compliance with the relevant legislation.
						3.2. A Retail Loan can be applied for by submitting form completed as appropriate to the given loan type,
						which shall be accompanied by the certificates, agreements, information and other documents required
						by the Bank.
						3.3. The Bank shall be entitled to examine the Client’s creditability and repayment potential as well as the
						collateral value and enforceability of the Collateral offered and other relevant conditions. The Client
						shall provide the Bank with the necessary certificates and information in the form requested by the
						Bank. Within the framework of the law, the Bank defines the principles of the Client’s creditability test
						itself and can modify them if it finds any modification reasonable and necessary. During the credit
						decision the Bank shall also be entitled to use data from the Central Credit Information System
						managed by Bankközi Informatika Szolgáltató Rt. (BISZ Zrt.). In accordance with the relevant laws and
						the normal legal practice, the Bank shall be entitled to use every possible means and method during
						the total Tenor to verify the authenticity of the certificates, information as well as the other deeds and
						data provided by the Client, and – if necessary – the Bank may request that they should be provided
						repeatedly.
						3.4. Based on the credit decision, the Bank may decide that the amount of the loan to be granted should be
						lower than requested and change the other terms and conditions, too. If the repayment of the loan and
						the related fees and charges do not seem to be ensured, the Bank can decide to reject the application.
						3.5. It is the Bank’s right to establish whether the Client is creditworthy and to decide to accept or refuse the
						loan application; the Bank exercises this right at its own discretion based on the principles based on
						the provisions of the effective laws.
						3.6. A Loan Agreement is concluded in writing and, unless otherwise provided for in the Client Agreement,
						enters into force on the day when the individual Client Agreement is corporately signed by the Bank
						and the other parties (e.g. Debtor, Co-debtor, Payment Guarantor, mortgagor) as well as – if necessary
						– two witnesses, and all the contractual conditions precedent, including particularly but not exclusively
						the consent or approval by a third person or authority, are met. In case of an interest-subsidised loan
						secured by a mortgage bond, Mortgage Loan and the other Consumer Loans under the Announcement
						of the Bank, the Loan Agreement, and the independent pledge agreement shall be notarised. Until the
						notarisation is effected, the Bank can refuse to disburse the loan. In addition to the above, the Bank
						can stipulate in the Loan Agreement that the notarisation of the Loan Agreement is a condition
						precedent of the disbursement.
						3.7. When the Bank wishes to enter into a Loan Agreement with the Debtor, it will provide the Debtor, without
						imposing any fees, charges or other sums payable, with a personalised draft Client Agreement including
						the Debtor’s personal data and the approved loan conditions. In case of a Mortgage Loan Agreement
						a draft agreement prepared as described above will be considered an offer binding on the Bank and
						should be delivered to the Debtor at the latest 3 days prior to concluding the agreement. The Loan
						Agreement may be concluded only after the three days following the delivery of the draft Client
						Agreement have passed. The offer will remain binding for the Bank for 15 days following the delivery
						of the draft agreement to the Debtor.
						RETAIL LOANS 7
						3.8. As a precondition for granting the Loan, the Bank may require the inclusion as Co-debtor especially of
						a spouse (partner) or the owners of the real estate offered as collateral or other persons holding certain
						rights to the same.
						3.9. Even after the individual Client Agreement is signed, the Bank may refuse to disburse the loan in case
						of any major changes in the Client’s circumstances or the value or enforceability of the Collateral, based
						on which performance under the Loan Agreement can no longer be expected and the Client fails to
						supply satisfactory Collateral in spite of a request for the same.
